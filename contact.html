  <center><b>Mail-in repair instructions</b><br><br>
 
<b>How does this work?</b><br><br>

Send us a message we will contact you, There are some devices we do not service due to lack of parts, age, & other reasons. We will provide you with an estimate after we received it. You do not pay until the service is complete. Once we receive your device we email you a ticket number.Before mailing something, please send us a message. Sometimes we receive devices with no note in the box, from people who have not contacted us before hand. We dont know who sent them, or what they want fixed. Please contact us first and include a small note in the box with your name on it. This way, we can match up the machine we receive to your online intake and swiftly process your repair.<br><br>

<b>Common Questions:</b><br><br>

<b>So you will figure out what is wrong for free?</b><br><br>

Yes. If you are a regular customer, we will provide you with a free estimate. The only fees you would incur would be paying to ship the laptop. We offer free estimates to all customers besides other repair shops. If you are a repair company, receiveing an estimate, and opt to not receive a repair, there is a bench fee of $50. Unfortunately, other stores have been firing their own technicians and having us do all of their estimates rather than paying a staff. If you own a store or repair company of any kind, please kindly hire your own staff. If you have tried to repair it yourself and failed in a manner that will make the tech's life harder, contact us before sending it in as free estimate may not apply. We may still be able to help you.<br><br>

<b>How much does a repair cost?</b><br><br>

You can click around the site to find prices for various issues from Mac laptop repair to data recovery. If you have a specific issue not addressed here, feel free to call us, email, or live chat. Knowing the model number and year of your machine is helpful to give you a price.<br><br>

 
<b>How much is return shipping?</b><br><br>

We offer free return shipping of your device, so we willl send it back to you if you have service done. If you decline to have the device repaired, there is a $20-$30 return shipping fee for devices where we do not perform a repair. Free shipping is exclusively for devices which we do repair. For larger, heavier devices, an additional fee for shipping may apply, or we may send it back without insurance if the shipping for your device reaches over $20.<br><br>
 
<b>Where do I send my device to?</b><br><br>

We accept mail-ins at our home base location, but only after you have contacted us first. The address is as follows.<br><br>
 
<b>ASAP PC FIX <br> 
3662 Old Greensboro Rd<br>
Winston-Salem , NC 27101</b><br><br>
 
<b>How long does a repair take?</b><br><br>

This really depends on what you are having done. Most screen repairs are done the same day. Same for keyboards, trackpads. Data recovery can be anywhere from one day to a month, motherboard repair can take anywhere from an hour to six weeks depending on the severity of the issue.
For your particular situation, feel free to email or call us to inquire about the turnaround time for your particular device.<br><br>
